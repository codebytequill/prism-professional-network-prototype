## The Vision

In an increasingly precarious economic and social landscape, safe spaces for marginalized communities are not a luxury—they are a necessity. "Prism" was born from the idea that LGBTQ+ professionals deserve a dedicated platform to connect, find opportunities, and build community without fear of prejudice or the need to code-switch.

This project, originally conceived in 2017, has been revitalized for 2025 to address the urgent, modern needs of our community. It's more than a "LinkedIn for queer people"; it's envisioned as a digital community center that prioritizes safety, authenticity, and mutual support.

## Core Features of the Prototype

This initial prototype is a non-functional, visual mock-up designed to showcase three core features:

1.  **Affirming Professional Profiles:** User profiles are designed from the ground up to be inclusive, featuring prominent and easy-to-use fields for pronouns and optional visual flags for identity (e.g., the non-binary flag colors). This allows users to present their full, authentic professional selves.

2.  **Vetted & Safe Job Board:** The job board includes a unique **"✓ LGBTQ+ Vetted Employer"** badge. This signifies that the companies posting have been reviewed for their inclusive policies, benefits, and workplace culture, giving job seekers confidence and peace of mind.

3.  **Community Resource Hub:** This section moves beyond simple networking to provide tangible support. It features a curated list of vital organizations offering legal aid, mental health services, mentorship, and professional development specifically for the LGBTQ+ community.

## Technology Used

This prototype is built with fundamental web technologies to be lightweight, accessible, and easy to understand.

* **HTML:** For the core structure and content.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For all styling and creating a clean, modern, responsive layout.
* **JavaScript:** For the simple navigation logic that switches between the "Profile," "Job Board," and "Resource Hub" views.

## How to Use This Prototype

This is a visual prototype and is not connected to a database. To run it locally:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
3.  Click on the navigation links in the sidebar to switch between the different views.

## The Road Ahead

This prototype is just the first step. The vision for Prism includes:

* A fully functional backend with secure user authentication.
* A robust messaging system for users to connect.
* Community-led groups and forums.
* A mentorship-matching feature.

This project is a labor of love and an act of community care. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are warmly welcomed.

## Acknowledgements

* This project is dedicated to the LGBTQ+ trailblazers who have fought for our right to exist safely and proudly in all spaces, including the workplace.
